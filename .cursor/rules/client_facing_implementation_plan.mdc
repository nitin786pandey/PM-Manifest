# Writing Client-Facing Implementation Plans

Use this rule whenever you must turn internal project details into a polished implementation plan ready to share with a client. The goal is to establish shared understanding, surface dependencies early, and build trust through clarity and transparency.

## Preparation Checklist
- Confirm problem statement, desired outcomes, and success metrics with the internal team.
- Gather scope boundaries, known assumptions, constraints, and in-scope/out-of-scope items.
- Identify all internal and client stakeholders, their roles, escalation paths, and availability.
- Collect the latest project timeline, milestone targets, resource assignments, and budget expectations.
- Inventory solution components (products, integrations, data flows) and any prerequisite client tasks.

## Required Plan Structure
1. **Executive Summary**
   - One or two paragraphs summarizing purpose, value to the client, and high-level approach.
   - Mention business outcomes and success metrics the plan supports.
2. **Objectives & Success Criteria**
   - List measurable objectives tied to client goals.
   - Define the metrics, target thresholds, and measurement cadence.
3. **Scope & Assumptions**
   - Detail what is included, excluded, and deferred.
   - Call out assumptions, constraints, and dependencies on client-side readiness.
4. **Stakeholders, Roles, & Governance**
   - Provide a RACI or clear role table covering both teams.
   - Add escalation paths, decision owners, and required approvals.
5. **Implementation Phases, Tasks, & Milestones**
   - Break the plan into phases (e.g., Discovery, Configuration, Testing, Launch, Optimization).
   - For each phase list key tasks, owners, start/end dates, dependencies, and milestone acceptance criteria.
6. **Resource & Environment Plan**
   - Specify staffing (internal + client), tools, environments, and access requirements.
   - Note onboarding steps, credential needs, and procurement timelines.
7. **Communication & Reporting Cadence**
   - Define meeting types, frequency, participants, and agendas.
   - Explain update formats (dashboards, status emails) and feedback channels.
8. **Risk & Issue Management**
   - Identify top risks with probability, impact, mitigation, and contingency plans.
   - Describe the process for logging, tracking, and resolving issues.
9. **Change Management, Training, & Adoption**
   - Outline change impacts, training plans, knowledge-transfer artifacts, and adoption KPIs.
   - Include client responsibilities for champion enablement or communications.
10. **Testing & Acceptance**
    - Document test strategy, required data, entry/exit criteria, and sign-off process.
    - Capture go/no-go checkpoints and rollback expectations.
11. **Go-Live & Post-Launch Support**
    - Detail cutover steps, support coverage (hours, channels, SLAs), and hypercare period.
    - Specify transition to steady-state support and handover deliverables.
12. **Client Action Items & Next Steps**
    - Summarize immediate client tasks with owners and due dates.
    - Highlight upcoming decision points and materials needed.

## Writing Guidelines
- **Client-first tone**: Focus on outcomes, value, and clarity; avoid internal jargon.
- **Transparency**: Surface assumptions, dependencies, and risks; show how you will manage them.
- **Tailoring**: Customize language, metrics, and timelines to the client’s industry, maturity, and priorities.
- **Precision**: Use specific dates, names, and measurable targets; avoid vague phrases.
- **Readability**: Favor short paragraphs, tables for schedules, and bullet lists for tasks.
- **Traceability**: Align every task and milestone back to objectives and success criteria.
- **Flexibility**: Note where the plan can adapt (e.g., optional phases, buffer windows) and how change requests will be handled.
- **Visual aids**: When possible, include timelines, responsibility matrices, or swimlanes for clarity.

## Quality Review Before Sharing
- Verify timeline logic (no orphaned tasks, realistic sequencing, noted dependencies).
- Confirm every stakeholder has clear responsibilities and communication expectations.
- Ensure risks have mitigation owners and the client knows their obligations.
- Double-check all acronyms, technical terms, and tool names are explained or linked to glossaries.
- Validate the plan against contractual commitments, scope, and budget.
- Proofread for consistency in tense, capitalization, and formatting.
- Provide a concise cover email or summary slide that reiterates purpose, key dates, and immediate asks.

## Ongoing Maintenance
- Update the plan after every major decision, scope change, or timeline shift.
- Version control changes and log rationale.
- Highlight updates during recurring status calls and document client approvals.
