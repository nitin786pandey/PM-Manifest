# How to Create Release Notes from Jira Tickets

This guide explains how to generate release notes from Jira tickets for Slack announcements.

## Workflow Overview

When a user requests release notes for a Jira ticket (e.g., "Make release notes for this JIRA-123"), follow these steps:

## Step 1: Fetch the Jira Ticket

1. **Extract the ticket identifier** from the user's request
   - Look for patterns like: "JIRA-123", "PROJ-456", or ticket IDs
   - The ticket key format is typically: `PROJECT-KEY-NUMBER`

2. **Use Atlassian MCP to fetch the ticket**
   - Use `mcp_atlassian_getJiraIssue` tool
   - Required parameters:
     - `cloudId`: Use `bikayiapp.atlassian.net` or extract from URL
     - `issueIdOrKey`: The ticket key (e.g., "JIRA-123")
   - Request additional fields if needed: `summary`, `description`, `status`, `labels`, `customfield_*`

3. **Handle authentication**
   - If MCP authentication fails, inform the user to check Atlassian MCP configuration
   - Reference `.cursor/rules/atlassian-mcp.mdc` for troubleshooting

## Step 2: Analyze the Ticket Content

1. **Read and understand the ticket**
   - Review the `summary` (title) to understand the main feature
   - Read the `description` for detailed context
   - Check `labels` and custom fields for additional context
   - Identify the target audience (e.g., Product Managers, Store Owners)

2. **Extract key information**
   - Main feature/capability being added
   - Primary use cases or problems solved
   - Benefits or value proposition
   - Any relevant technical details (if needed for context)

3. **Identify the product/feature area**
   - Determine which product this relates to (e.g., Manifest, BIK)
   - Understand the scope and impact

## Step 3: Create Release Notes

Structure the release notes following this format:

### Opening Statement
- Start with a brief, user-friendly introduction
- Focus on the value or capability being added
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Example structure: "We've added a new capability to help [target audience] [main benefit]."

### What it does (:mag_right:)
- List 2-3 bullet points explaining the functionality
- Focus on what users can do, not how it's implemented
- Use action-oriented language
- Keep each point concise and clear

### Example Use Cases (:bar_chart:)
- Organize by product name (e.g., Manifest, BIK)
- List 2-3 specific, real-world questions or scenarios
- Use question format: "How many stores have [specific feature]?"
- Make them concrete and relatable

### Why it matters (:bulb:)
- Provide 1-2 sentences explaining the value
- Focus on benefits and impact
- Connect to broader goals or outcomes
- Keep it concise and meaningful

## Step 4: Format for Slack

1. **Use Slack-compatible formatting**
   - Emoji codes: `:mag_right:`, `:bar_chart:`, `:bulb:`
   - Use bullet points with proper indentation
   - Ensure proper line breaks between sections
   - Keep formatting clean and readable

2. **Structure the output**
   - Opening statement (1-2 sentences)
   - Blank line
   - `:mag_right: What it does` section
   - Blank line
   - `:bar_chart: Example Use Cases` section (with product names)
   - Blank line
   - `:bulb: Why it matters` section

## Step 5: Output Text File

1. **Create a text file**
   - Save as `.txt` file in the workspace root or a designated location
   - Use descriptive filename: `release-notes-{TICKET-KEY}.txt` or `release-notes-{DATE}.txt`
   - Ensure the file is ready to copy-paste into Slack

2. **File content requirements**
   - Plain text format (no markdown syntax)
   - Proper spacing and line breaks
   - All emoji codes properly formatted
   - Ready for direct copy-paste to Slack

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
- **Be user-focused**: Write from the user's perspective, not technical implementation
- **Be concise**: Keep each section brief and scannable
- **Be specific**: Use concrete examples rather than vague descriptions
- **Be clear**: Avoid jargon and technical terms when possible
- **Be relevant**: Focus on what matters to the target audience

### Tone and Style
- Use friendly, professional tone
- Write in present tense ("We've added" not "We added")
- Use active voice
- Keep sentences short and clear
- Make it easy to scan quickly

### Quality Checks
- Verify all information is accurate from the Jira ticket
- Ensure examples are realistic and relevant
- Check that the value proposition is clear
- Confirm formatting will work in Slack
- Review for typos and clarity

## Troubleshooting

### If ticket information is incomplete
- Extract what's available from the ticket
- Use reasonable inferences based on ticket context
- Note any assumptions made
- Ask user for clarification if critical information is missing

### If MCP is unavailable
- Inform user to check Atlassian MCP configuration
- Reference `.cursor/rules/atlassian-mcp.mdc` for setup
- Suggest manual ticket lookup as alternative

### If ticket format is unclear
- Focus on the summary and description fields
- Look for acceptance criteria or user stories
- Extract key features from technical details
- Ask user for additional context if needed

## Example Workflow

1. User: "Make release notes for JIRA-123"
2. Fetch ticket using `mcp_atlassian_getJiraIssue`
3. Analyze summary, description, and related fields
4. Extract key features and use cases
5. Structure release notes following the format
6. Create `release-notes-JIRA-123.txt` file
7. Present the file to user for review

## Notes

- Always verify the ticket exists and is accessible
- If multiple tickets are mentioned, create separate release notes for each
- For epic tickets, consider breaking down into multiple release notes for individual features
- Keep the release notes focused on user value, not technical implementation details
