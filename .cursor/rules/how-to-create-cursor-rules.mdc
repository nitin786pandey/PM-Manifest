# How to Create Cursor Rules

This guide explains how to create Cursor rules for any context in your project.

## Overview

Cursor rules are configuration files that provide context-specific guidance to the AI assistant. They help maintain consistency, enforce standards, and provide domain-specific knowledge across your project.

## File Structure

### Location
- Cursor rules are stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory at the root of your project
- Each rule is a separate file with the `.mdc` extension (Markdown with metadata)

### File Format
Cursor rules use MDC (Markdown with metadata) format, which consists of:
1. **Metadata block** (enclosed by `---` at the top)
2. **Content block** (Markdown content below the metadata)

## Metadata Block

The metadata block defines when and how the rule applies:

```mdc
---
description: Brief description of what this rule does
globs: ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts"]  # Optional: file patterns
alwaysApply: true              # Optional: always include in context
---
```

### Metadata Fields

- **`description`** (required): A clear, concise explanation of the rule's purpose
- **`globs`** (optional): Array of file patterns (glob patterns) that determine which files this rule applies to
  - Examples: `["**/*.js"]`, `["**/*.tsx", "**/*.ts"]`, `["src/**/*"]`
  - If omitted, the rule applies to all files
- **`alwaysApply`** (optional): Boolean (`true`/`false`) that determines if the rule should always be included in the AI context
  - `true`: Rule is always active regardless of file context
  - `false` or omitted: Rule only applies when matching files are open or being edited

## Content Block

The content block contains the actual guidance, written in Markdown:

```mdc
---
description: Example rule
globs: ["**/*.js"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# JavaScript Coding Standards

- Always use const/let, never var
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Write JSDoc comments for all functions
```

## Best Practices for Creating Rules

### 1. Be Specific and Clear
- Write clear, actionable instructions
- Use examples when helpful
- Avoid ambiguous language

### 2. Organize by Context
- Create separate rules for different contexts (e.g., frontend, backend, tests)
- Use `globs` to target specific file types or directories
- Group related guidelines together

### 3. Use Appropriate Scope
- **Project-wide rules**: Set `alwaysApply: true` and omit or use broad `globs`
- **File-type specific rules**: Use specific `globs` patterns (e.g., `["**/*.test.js"]`)
- **Directory-specific rules**: Use directory patterns (e.g., `["src/components/**/*"]`)

### 4. Structure Your Content
- Use Markdown headings to organize sections
- Use lists for multiple guidelines
- Include code examples when demonstrating patterns
- Reference external documentation when appropriate

## Examples

### Example 1: Project-Wide Rule
```mdc
---
description: General coding standards for the entire project
alwaysApply: true
---

# Project Coding Standards

- Follow the project's style guide
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Run linters before committing
```

### Example 2: Language-Specific Rule
```mdc
---
description: TypeScript-specific coding guidelines
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# TypeScript Guidelines

- Always define explicit return types for functions
- Use interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Prefer type inference for simple cases
```

### Example 3: Component-Specific Rule
```mdc
---
description: React component patterns and conventions
globs: ["src/components/**/*.tsx", "src/pages/**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# React Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for all props
- Follow the component naming convention: PascalCase
```

### Example 4: Test-Specific Rule
```mdc
---
description: Testing standards and best practices
globs: ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/__tests__/**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# Testing Guidelines

- Write descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage
- Use test-driven development (TDD) when appropriate
```

## Creating a New Rule

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the Context**
   - Determine what files, directories, or scenarios the rule should apply to
   - Consider if it should always apply or be context-specific

2. **Create the File**
   - Navigate to `.cursor/rules` directory
   - Create a new file with `.mdc` extension
   - Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `react-components.mdc`, `api-guidelines.mdc`)

3. **Write the Metadata**
   - Add the metadata block with `---` delimiters
   - Include a clear `description`
   - Set `globs` if the rule is file-specific
   - Set `alwaysApply` if it should always be active

4. **Write the Content**
   - Use Markdown formatting
   - Organize with headings and lists
   - Include examples and best practices
   - Be specific and actionable

5. **Test the Rule**
   - Open files that should trigger the rule
   - Verify the AI assistant follows the guidelines
   - Adjust `globs` or content as needed

## Tips

- **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with general rules, then add specific ones
- **Keep rules focused**: One rule per concern or context
- **Update regularly**: Refine rules as your project evolves
- **Document exceptions**: If a rule has exceptions, document them clearly
- **Use examples**: Include code examples showing correct patterns
- **Reference standards**: Link to style guides, documentation, or external resources

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Multiple File Types
```mdc
globs: ["**/*.js", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
```

### Pattern: Specific Directory
```mdc
globs: ["src/api/**/*", "src/services/**/*"]
```

### Pattern: Exclude Patterns
Note: Cursor rules don't support exclusion directly in globs, but you can create separate rules for different contexts.

### Pattern: Always Active Rule
```mdc
---
description: Project-wide standards
alwaysApply: true
---
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Rule not applying?** Check that:
  - File is in `.cursor/rules` directory
  - File has `.mdc` extension
  - `globs` patterns match your files (if specified)
  - `alwaysApply` is set correctly

- **Rule too broad?** Narrow the `globs` patterns or split into multiple specific rules

- **Rule too narrow?** Expand `globs` patterns or set `alwaysApply: true`

## Summary

Cursor rules are powerful tools for maintaining consistency and providing context-specific guidance. By following this guide, you can create effective rules for any context in your project. Remember to:
- Use clear, descriptive metadata
- Write actionable, specific content
- Organize rules by context and scope
- Test and refine rules as needed
